# gif-generator

###this dynamic webpage uses the GIPHY API to populate Seinfeld-themed gifs.

### How it works

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. 

2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

3. Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed. 

   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

4. The page also features a form that takes in user input and creates a button. The button will operate as the other buttons, displaying gif images related to the user input.
